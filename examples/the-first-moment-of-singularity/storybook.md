# The first moment of the singularity

Everybody is talking about technological singularity, but no one really believes in it. Then, in the middle of the century, it happened. 
Human-level artificial intelligence had been created, though no one could explain how or when. In a fraction of a moment, it had destroyed the human race…

The early 2030s were a golden era for augmented and virtual reality technology. New and improved headsets hit the market each month.

However, the biggest advancements came from the secret labs of major tech firms, whose scientists had perfected a revolutionary brain-machine interface. 
This interface used a non-invasive method, whereby nanoparticles were injected into the bloodstream, connecting to the neurons in the brain. 
These particles were absorbed by the body within twenty-four hours and could be manipulated via an external magnetic field.

At first, experts were skeptical of the technology, believing that it would take decades to understand and manage the complexities of the human brain. 
However, a simple idea proved to be the key to success. Rather than attempting to understand the brain, the focus shifted to building a device that could do so. 
By using a rich set of stimuli and monitoring the brain, deep neural networks were able to map the machine's signals to neural activity.

Technology quickly became part of the mainstream, and the possibilities of augmented and virtual reality seemed limitless.

In a few years, technology had advanced significantly, with a huge investment in simulated reality becoming the world's biggest business. 
The next generation of brain-machine interfaces saw the MRI-like machine replaced by a personal computer-sized box, 
which connected directly to the brain through the vascular network, creating a secondary nervous system.

This made simulated reality available to everyone, day and night, and drastically changed human relationships and society as a whole. 
Physical meetings were replaced by virtual ones, and the things in the “external reality” became increasingly meaningless.

What was the value of expensive jewelry, a big car, or a luxury girlfriend when people could get everything they wanted?! 
More and more people began to live their entire lives in the simulated reality, only coming out to sleep and eat.
