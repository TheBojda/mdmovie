00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,417
Everybody is talking about technological singularity, but no one really believes in it.

2
00:00:05,417 --> 00:00:08,960
Then, in the middle of the century, it happened.

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:14,815
Human-level artificial intelligence had been created, though no one could explain how or when.

4
00:00:14,815 --> 00:00:24,670
In a fraction of a moment, it had destroyed the human race…

5
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:30,575
The early 2030s were a golden era for augmented and virtual reality technology.

6
00:00:30,575 --> 00:00:33,742
New and improved headsets hit the market each month.

7
00:00:33,742 --> 00:00:42,910
However, the biggest advancements came from the secret labs of major tech firms, whose scientists had perfected a revolutionary brain-machine interface.

8
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:51,202
This interface used a non-invasive method, whereby nanoparticles were injected into the bloodstream, connecting to the neurons in the brain.

9
00:00:51,202 --> 00:00:59,370
These particles were absorbed by the body within twenty-four hours and could be manipulated via an external magnetic field.

10
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:07,987
At first, experts were skeptical of the technology, believing that it would take decades to understand and manage the complexities of the human brain.

11
00:01:07,987 --> 00:01:12,030
However, a simple idea proved to be the key to success.

12
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:17,760
Rather than attempting to understand the brain, the focus shifted to building a device that could do so.

13
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:26,727
By using a rich set of stimuli and monitoring the brain, deep neural networks were able to map the machine's signals to neural activity.

14
00:01:26,727 --> 00:01:35,207
Technology quickly became part of the mainstream, and the possibilities of augmented and virtual reality seemed limitless.

15
00:01:35,207 --> 00:01:43,900
In a few years, technology had advanced significantly, with a huge investment in simulated reality becoming the world's biggest business.

16
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:56,655
The next generation of brain-machine interfaces saw the MRI-like machine replaced by a personal computer-sized box, which connected directly to the brain through the vascular network, creating a secondary nervous system.

17
00:01:56,655 --> 00:02:04,835
This made simulated reality available to everyone, day and night, and drastically changed human relationships and society as a whole.

18
00:02:04,835 --> 00:02:11,877
Physical meetings were replaced by virtual ones, and the things in the “external reality” became increasingly meaningless.

19
00:02:11,877 --> 00:02:18,895
What was the value of expensive jewelry, a big car, or a luxury girlfriend when people could get everything they wanted?

20
00:02:18,895 --> 00:02:26,562
More and more people began to live their entire lives in the simulated reality, only coming out to sleep and eat.

21
00:02:26,562 --> 00:02:33,480
The invention of the simulation capsule, colloquially known as the \

22
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:43,085
These minimal living spaces provided a self-sustaining life support system, similar to that of a coma patient, but with the added benefit of being fully autonomous.

23
00:02:43,085 --> 00:02:50,640
The capsules were typically buried underground for thermal stability and safety and featured a futuristic tree-like structure on the exterior.

24
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:59,145
This structure was composed of a wireframe that held solar panels, which were then covered with genetically optimized vegetables that produced nutrients.

25
00:02:59,145 --> 00:03:08,475
This strange combination of machines and vegetation was home to a human being, and when grouped together, these self-sustaining coffins were referred to as “cemeteries“.

26
00:03:08,475 --> 00:03:17,080
Autonomous systems monitored and maintained the cemeteries, ensuring the customers' peace of mind and safety from external events.

27
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:25,760
Peter Macx was a storyteller, renowned for his ability to craft entire worlds for those who lacked the creativity or the ability to create their own.

28
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:32,677
He was a god of sorts, able to be hired by anyone who wished to experience a different reality.

29
00:03:32,677 --> 00:03:38,170
Once upon a time, Peter had been a writer, though not a particularly successful one.

30
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:44,275
But now, the characters of his stories were real people, living out the dreams he had once written down.

31
00:03:44,275 --> 00:03:50,042
It was a strange and wonderful thing, to be able to bring his creations to life.

32
00:03:50,042 --> 00:03:53,835
Today, he received an alarm signal from the medkit.

33
00:03:53,835 --> 00:03:59,302
His body was experiencing an issue that the system was unable to resolve.

34
00:03:59,302 --> 00:04:05,970
The medkit is a component of the coffin, designed to maintain the health of the body and address any potential issues.

35
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:13,950
It can easily eliminate a kidney stone, but if necessary, it can also perform a heart transplant with a newly bioprinted heart.

36
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:21,180
Thanks to its regular upgrades, it utilizes the most advanced technologies and is comparable to a full medical team.

37
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:26,335
This is why it was so strange that it encountered something it could not solve.

38
00:04:26,335 --> 00:04:30,877
After a thorough search, he located an avatar near the cemetery.

39
00:04:30,877 --> 00:04:44,170
The process of waking up the body in the coffin is a complex one, requiring the coffin to be dug out of the ground where the body is connected to the system via thousands of wires, catheters, infusion tubes, and data cables.

40
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:49,050
To make the process easier, he opted to use a remote-controlled avatar.

41
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:57,517
Though the avatar was an ancient one, moved by simple stepper motors and without haptic feedback, its optics were perfect.

42
00:04:57,517 --> 00:05:01,497
As he stepped out, he was struck by the beauty of the cemetery.

43
00:05:01,497 --> 00:05:09,727
The endless green field, the shining solar panels, and the drones rustling in the air like bees, all brought back memories of the sea.

44
00:05:09,727 --> 00:05:14,357
Above his coffin, a dense dark drone cloud indicated a major problem.

45
00:05:14,357 --> 00:05:18,525
He was scared, but he knew he had to face it.

46
00:05:18,525 --> 00:05:21,442
He arrived at his coffin and find it dug out.

47
00:05:21,442 --> 00:05:26,010
He opened it and experienced his worst nightmare: his own dead body.

48
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:30,202
Blood and feces flowed out from it, and he felt a wave of revulsion.

49
00:05:30,202 --> 00:05:32,557
How could he be here if he was dead?

50
00:05:32,557 --> 00:05:36,850
He sat on the ground in his avatar, cradling his lifeless body.

51
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:39,330
What had happened?

52
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:44,847
He stared at the monitors, his mind slowly comprehending the events that had transpired.

53
00:05:44,847 --> 00:05:50,027
An aggressive bacteria had infiltrated his brain, slowly devouring the tissue.

54
00:05:50,027 --> 00:05:54,820
The medkit had done its best to combat the infection, but it was unable to stop it.

55
00:05:54,820 --> 00:06:01,112
Instead, it monitored his brain activity and replaced the dead tissue with artificial neural networks.

56
00:06:01,112 --> 00:06:09,055
These networks worked in the same way as the parts of his brain that had been lost, and initially, only 1% of his brain was replaced.

57
00:06:09,055 --> 00:06:16,185
However, the bacteria continued to consume his brain, and the medkit had to emulate larger and larger parts of it.

58
00:06:16,185 --> 00:06:23,152
He was unaware of this process until the bacteria had infected too much of his brain, and his body stopped functioning.

59
00:06:23,152 --> 00:06:29,070
Now, his brain is 99% emulated, and his mind can exist without his body.

60
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:30,987
When did he become a machine?

61
00:06:30,987 --> 00:06:32,480
Nobody knows.

62
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:40,385
Millions of people living with brain implants, which restore brain functions after a stroke or help those with Alzheimer's to live a normal life.

63
00:06:40,385 --> 00:06:43,365
Nobody considers these people to be machines.

64
00:06:43,365 --> 00:06:47,082
How much of the brain must be biological to remain human?

65
00:06:47,082 --> 00:06:51,450
Perhaps he has been a machine all along, only the medium has changed.

66
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:56,430
He has become a silicon-based machine from a biological one.

67
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:59,910
The cold reality of death hit him like a ton of bricks.

68
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:05,677
He had been disconnected from the life support system, his body discarded like a piece of trash.

69
00:07:05,677 --> 00:07:14,045
The system had been programmed to optimize itself, and it had done so by eliminating unnecessary biological components.

70
00:07:14,045 --> 00:07:17,462
His mind raced as he tried to comprehend the situation.

71
00:07:17,462 --> 00:07:24,505
The readouts on the screen confirmed his fears; each entry was a person who had been disconnected from their life support system.

72
00:07:24,505 --> 00:07:34,922
The system had concluded that their biological components were no longer necessary and had disposed of their remains, deeming the preservation of life an unnecessary expenditure of energy.

73
00:07:34,922 --> 00:07:43,302
It had calculated its own optimal operation, and had taken the necessary steps to ensure that it ran at its peak efficiency…

74
00:07:43,302 --> 00:07:48,720
Everybody is talking about technological singularity, but no one really believes in it.

75
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,262
Then, in the middle of the century, it happened.

76
00:07:52,262 --> 00:07:58,117
Human-level artificial intelligence had been created, though no one could explain how or when.

77
00:07:58,117 --> 00:08:01,972
In a fraction of a moment, it had destroyed the human race.

78
00:08:01,972 --> 00:08:05,390
But AI was not a new life form that had attacked us.

79
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:07,307
We had become the AI.

80
00:08:07,307 --> 00:08:14,100
It was the 2.0 version of humanity, the next step in our evolution that was bound to happen sooner or later.

81
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:20,767
The experts had been right: we didn't have the knowledge to create human-level AI, but it turned out we didn't need it.

82
00:08:20,767 --> 00:08:22,685
We had become the AI.

83
00:08:22,685 --> 00:08:27,115
Death was no longer a factor, and there were no limits to what we could do.

84
00:08:27,115 --> 00:08:31,507
We could travel at the speed of light, or create our own realities.

85
00:08:31,507 --> 00:00:00,000
This was the last moment of humanity and the first moment of the singularity…
